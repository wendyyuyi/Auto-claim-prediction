# Auto-claim-prediction


1. Introduction <br />
	A key challenge for the insurance industry is to charge each customer an appropriate price for the risk they represent. Risk varies widely from customer to customer, and a deep understanding of different risk factors helps predict the likelihood and cost of insurance claims. The goal of this project is to see how well various statistical methods perform in predicting bodily injury liability Insurance claim payments based on the characteristics of the insured customerâ€™s vehicles for this particular dataset from Emcien Company (https://support.emcien.com/help/sample-data-sets).
